## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.

## Why use Markdown?
We use Markdown to help give instructions to either ourselves when coding (after a prolonged break in coding), or people with whom are helping to build our site.
