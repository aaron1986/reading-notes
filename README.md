## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.

## Why use Markdown?
We use Markdown to help give instructions to either ourselves when coding (after a prolonged break in coding), or people with whom are helping to build our site. 

*italicized example*

**bold text**

`code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Title of the document</title>
</head>

<body>
The content of the document......
</body>

</html> 
`
